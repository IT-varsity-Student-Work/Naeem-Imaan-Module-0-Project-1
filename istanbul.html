        <h2>ABOUT ISTANBUL</h2>
        <p>Istanbul is a major city in Turkey that straddles Europe and Asia across the Bosphorus Strait. Its Old City reflects cultural influences of the many empires that once ruled here.Every country has its most prominent city and in the case of Turkey, this is Istanbul. Throughout the history of humankind, it has been a pinnacle point of travel, trade, politics and war.Theres a reason why Istanbul is quickly becoming many travelers favorite city. Not only is this a city located on two separate continents, complete with a wide range of diverse and fascinating neighborhoods wherever you wander, but you also have an abundance of history to explore, a mouth-watering cuisine to enjoy and even some nightlife that rivals that of many major party places around the world.Its easy to spend a full day roaming around just one of the areas of Istanbul, whether it be Kadikoy or Uskudar on the Asian side or Taksim, Beyoglu, Besiktas, Eminonu, Karakoy or Sultanahment on the European side. Heck, an entire day or two could be spent visiting the two main attractions in the city, the mesmerizingly impressive Hagia Sophia and the gorgeous Blue Mosque.But after you check those two off your list, youll still need plenty of time to tackle the Grand Bazaar, Sulameiniya Mosque, the Spice Bazaar, Galata Tower, a ferry ride across the Bosphorus Strait, a visit to Dolbache Palace, an evening out along Istikal Street, among many others. At first, the city can appear to be expensive and a bit overwhelming, but travelers quickly discover that once you walk a few blocks away from the tourist areas, youll discover an entire world of local eateries and shops, pomegranate juice and roasted chestnut vendors, shisha cafes, bars and more,all at prices that will barely affect your wallet.And believe me, youll quickly become addicted to listening to the ??? call to prayer being said from the mosques five times each day, especially around sunset as the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia look their best.  </p>
